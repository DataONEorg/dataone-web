// Pages are structed such that they contain a header (with navigation), an
// article (main content, including page header and a series of sections), plus
// a footer. The overall layout for pages is found in the
// layout/_default/baseof.html file. The "main" part contains the article, each
// of which has a slightly different layout depending on page type - eg blocks,
// news/single.html, jobs/single.html, news/webinar.html, etc. This scss file
// provides styles that are used by all the "article" elements. It positions the
// page header, sections, and footer relative to one another.
//
.article {
  // sections without headers need a margin to leave space for the nav
  .section:first-child{
    @include desktop{
      margin-top : $nav-height - 0.05rem;
    }
  }
}
