abstract: How much do you think about your users’ experiences? Are you building data
  products that address your users’ needs? The User-eXperience Lab (UXL) at the University
  of Tennessee performs UX testing to improve how users interact with technology.
  The UXL has been working with DataONE and the RDM community for over a decade to
  help create better products that engage and empower users and stakeholders. Join
  us at the DataONE Community Call on January 7 for a conversation about the current
  state of UX in the DataONE community and how we can increase data usage, improve
  user satisfaction and trust in repositories, and help data organizations make development
  decisions that save time and money.
