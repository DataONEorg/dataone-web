  Educational materials developed by the DataONE project, and available for community contributions, can support a wide variety of training needs by the DataONE community. The curated collection externally developed training resources discoverable through the DMTC provides a complementary selection of materials that are discoverable using criteria such as target audience, disciplinary focus, topic, and license terms. This community call will discuss current DataONE research data management training materials, activities and resources in the context of broader community initiatives. All individuals with an interest in data management training should attend.
