short_abstract: Review and dicussion of proposed extensions to the DataONE object
  format vocabulary.
abstract: To increase interoperability across the network, DataONE provides an object
  format service that provides a consistent vocabulary for the types of data and metadata
  objects that are available from repositories. Each data file or metadata file is
  associated with one of these object format identifiers, which provides our web interface
  and other client tools the information needed to properly process and parse the
  format. The object format vocabulary is extensible, and so we could review upcoming
  proposed extensions to the vocabulary, discuss the process for proposing extensions,
  and identify additional formats that would be useful. In addition, we could discuss
  whether the object format vocabulary should be modified to include URIs for each
  vocabulary term, and whether it should be published in RDF or OWL in a system like
  the ESIP Community Ontology Repository.
