abstract: 'The selection of licenses for data and metadata hosted in repositories,
  shared by researchers, and reused by end users necessarily reflects an attempt to
  balance a variety of interests. A sample of these interests includes researcher
  interest in receiving proper attribution for their work in creating data, sponsor
  interests in maximizing the impact of the support they provide, repository interests
  in having the necessary rights to manage and provide access to data and metadata
  they host, and end user interests in being able to use the data they find with minimal
  restrictions and requirements. This DataONE Community Call will bring together the
  community and a group of invited participants to discuss the lessons learned and
  decisions made in selecting data licenses for use in a variety of contexts.
