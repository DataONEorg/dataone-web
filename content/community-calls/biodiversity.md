abstract: Join us for our next DataONE Community Call, where we’ll spotlight ongoing efforts to connect and enhance biodiversity data across global networks. This session will highlight how biodiversity repositories are connected through federation and shared metadata practices to enhance data visibility, interoperability, and long-term access. We’ll share how DataONE supports these efforts by onboarding repositories like OBIS-SEAMAP, strengthening connections with global biodiversity initiatives such as GBIF and iDigBio.
