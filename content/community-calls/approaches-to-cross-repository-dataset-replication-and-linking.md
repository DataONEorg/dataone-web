abstract: Repositories frequently need to both replicate datasets that are held in
  other repositories (for policy, availability, and other reasons) and to link to
  external datasets that represent sometimes the same and sometimes related datasets.
  For example, the Arctic Data Center frequently needs to replicate datasets from
  EDI to meet NSF policy guidelines, and so have developed out a streamlined workflow
  to make sure that researchers do not have to double enter their metadata or data.
  Being able to generalize these capabilities across the network could increase efficiency
  and reduce duplication.
