short_abstract: This community call will bring together panelists from multiple networks
  that have some degree of existing connectivity with the DataONE networked community
  and start a discussion focused on opportunities for collaborative and coordinated
  activities that can efficiently meet and provide cost-effective solutions for shared
  community needs while contributing to increased sustainability of network capabilities.
abstract: Many of us participate in multiple cyberinfrastructure, disciplinary, and
  professional networks as part of our daily work. While these networks frequently
  provide complementary resources and capabilities there are cases where there might
  be duplicative efforts or capabilities that coordination between networks might
  help reduce (if appropriate). This community call will bring together representatives
  from multiple networks that have some degree of existing connectivity with the DataONE
  network and community and start a discussion focused on opportunities for collaborative
  and coordinated activities that can efficiently meet and provide cost-effective
  solutions for shared community needs while contributing to increased sustainability
  of network capabilities.
