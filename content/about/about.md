    about life on earth and the environment that sustains it
  intro: DataONE is a community driven project providing access to data across multiple
    member repositories, supporting enhanced search and discovery of Earth and environmental
    data. DataONE promotes best practices in data management through responsive educational
    resources and materials. We envision researchers, educators, and the public using
    DataONE to better understand and conserve life on earth and the environment that
