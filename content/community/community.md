  intro: |-
    The DataONE Community Group is the worldwide community of researchers, information managers, librarians, data authors, users, and diverse stakeholders that makeup the DataONE partnership communities. The primary function of the Community Group is to represent the needs and interests of these communities in the activities of DataONE and provide guidance that informs the development and activities of DataONE, facilitating the organization in achieving its vision and mission.

    Members of the Community Group include representatives of the Member Repositories and all other relevant groups (e.g. research networks, professional societies, libraries, academic institutions, data centers, data repositories, environmental observatory networks, educators, scientists, policy makers, administrators, citizen scientists, international organizations, NGOs, private companies, etc.)

    The Community Group meets annually to identify the evolving technical challenges and opportunities that can be applied to advance education, research, and policy through the use of DataONE data products, tools, and services.

  title: DataONE Community Board
  intro: "As DataONE transitions from funded project to sustained program, we have
    reenvisioned our governance structure to ensure the program more directly integrates
    the need of our collaborators, participants and users as part of the decision-making
    for future activities.\n\nWe seek to establish a community and stakeholder driven
    governance model, where community input will encompass topics conferencing infrastructure,
    software, services, collaborative proposals, community development and maintenance
    and assessment.\n\nDataONE Governance Model comprises participants across four
    primary groups: the Management Team, Advisory Board, DataONE Community and the
    DataONE Community Board. This community elected Board works to develop and ratifies
    community guidance to the DataONE Management Team with input from the broader
    DataONE Community. We welcome expressions of interest with respect to serving
    on the Board.\n\n  \n  \n "
