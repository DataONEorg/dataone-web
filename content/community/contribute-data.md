    Data becomes available in the DataONE catalog once it's published in a Member Repository.
    Each member accepts data into their repository through their own submission process.

## Finding a Member Repository

The [Current Member Repositories page]( {{< ref "network.md#list-of-member-repositories" >}} )
lists all of the current Member Repositories which are part of the DataONE network.
We are working as quickly as we can to integrate the many other data organizations who would like to become a Member Repository.
If you work with a data repository which is not listed as a current Member Repository, you can contact the repository management to inquire if they are working on [becoming a Member Repository with DataONE]( {{< ref "jointhenetwork.md" >}} ).

#### Dryad

If your data is associated with any published article in the biosciences, you may be able to deposit it with the Dryad data project, which is one of our Member Repositories. See [Dryad's submission page](https://datadryad.org/stash/submission_process) for more information.

#### Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity

If you work with one of the many projects that use [Metacat](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/docs/) as part of the [Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB)](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), you may be able to deposit data through that project.

## Submitting Data to a Member Repository

The details of how to submit data to a Member Repository depend on the Member Repository and the software that particular repository is running.
For Member Repositories running [MetacatUI](https://nceas.github.io/metacatui/), the submission process can be as easy as using the Metadata Editor to save the data to your repository's Metacat instance. Other repositories, such as the ORNL DAAC, have much more involved data review and curation practices.

## Other Data Repositories

DataONE is working to expand the network of organizations and repositories that make up our Member Repositories. However, there is a wide array of repositories available for archiving your data that may differ with respect to cost, disciplinary scope, size of holdings, metadata requirements etc. [Registry of Research Data Repositories (r3data)](http://re3data.org/) has compiled a searchable catalog of research data repositories and it is worth exploring the options available here if current DataONE Member Repositories do not meet your needs. However, data in these repositories will not be exposed through a DataONE search until the repository is integrated as a Member Repository.
