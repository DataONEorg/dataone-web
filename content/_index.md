        description: As a best practice, one must first acknowledge that the process
          of managing data will incur costs. Researchers should plan to address these
          costs and the allocation of resources in the early planning phases of the
          project. This best practice focuses on data management costs during the
          life cycle of the project, and does not aim to address costs of data beyond
          the end of the project.
