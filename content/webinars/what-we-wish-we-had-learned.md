  that have tremendous benefits for both the research community and society.
abstract: Data management training for graduate students is a very important but often
  undervalued area of graduate school education. Many graduate students will go on
  and become professionals who are using, producing, and/or managing data that have
  tremendous benefits for both the research community and society. However, our personal
  experiences as graduate students show that data lifecycle and data management training
  are not part of the core curriculum in graduate school. As Earth Science Information
  Partners (ESIP) Community Fellows, we understand that data management is a critical
  skill in earth science and we all wished we had an opportunity to integrate it from
  the beginning in our graduate school experience. To the issue of lack of formal
  data management training in graduate education, we convened a working session during
  the 2020 ESIP Summer Meeting called “What we wish we had learned in Graduate School?”
  The session was initially planned as a working session for early career professionals
  to share resources and lessons learned during our own graduate school experiences.
  The session has sparked broad interests from the Earth science data community and
  attracted participants across different career stages and with different levels
  of expertise. The outcome of the session has been summarized as a roadmap that follows
  the DataONE Data Lifecycle. This roadmap projects the data lifecycle into the traditional
  graduate school timeline and highlights the benefits and resources of data management
  training for each component in the data lifecycle. This roadmap for graduate data
  management training will be distributed via ESIP and be continued as part of the
  ESIP Community Program in the future to promote data management training for graduate
  students in Earth sciences and beyond.
