short_abstract: Open, accessible, and high-quality data along with related data products
  and software are critical to the integrity of published research. To address this
  critical need, a coalition of groups representing the international Earth and space
  science community, convened by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), will develop
  standards that connect researchers, publishers, and data repositories in the Earth
  and space sciences to enable FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable)
  data – a concept first developed by Force11.org – on a large scale. We discuss the
  project objectives, timeline, and how you and your organization can be involved.
abstract: |-
  Open, accessible, and high-quality data along with related data products and software are critical to the integrity of published research. They ensure transparency and support reproducibility and are necessary for accelerating the advancement of science. In many cases, the data are one-time observations that cannot be repeated. Unfortunately, not all key data are saved and even when they are, their curation is uneven and discovery is difficult, thus making it difficult for other researchers to understand and use the data sets.

  To address this critical need, a coalition of groups representing the international Earth and space science community, convened by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), will develop standards that connect researchers, publishers, and data repositories in the Earth and space sciences to enable FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data – a concept first developed by Force11.org – on a large scale. We discuss the project objectives, timeline, and how you and your organization can be involved.
