short_abstract: Most scientists have experienced the disappointment of opening an
  old data file and not fully understanding the contents. During data collection,
  we frequently optimize ease and efficiency of data entry, producing files that are
  not well formatted or described for longer term uses, perhaps assuming in the moment
  that the details of our experiments and observations would be impossible to forget.
  We can make the best of our sometimes embarrassing data management errors by using
  them as ‘teachable moments’, opening our dusty file drawers to explore the most
  common errors, and some quick fixes to improve day-to-day approaches to data.
