short_abstract: I shall use a case-study of the ‘rescue’ of a compiled set of continent-wide
  vegetation survey data that, although the analyses had been published, the raw data
  had not (*Specht et al., 2018). In the original study, publications containing plot
  data collected from the 1880s onwards had been collected, interpreted, digitised,
  and integrated for the classification of vegetation and analysis of its conservation
  status across Australia.

  Successful maintenance and accessibility of ecological data enables comprehension of the nature and causes of ecosystem change and makes informed action possible. However, much valuable data are not in institutional hands, and there are many pitfalls of non-institutional ecological data conservation. Interruptions to custodianship, outdated media, lost knowledge and the continuous evolution of species names makes conservation of such data challenging.

  I shall use a case-study of the ‘rescue’ of a compiled set of continent-wide vegetation survey data that, although the analyses had been published, the raw data had not (*Specht et al., 2018). In the original study, publications containing plot data collected from the 1880s onwards had been collected, interpreted, digitised, and integrated for the classification of vegetation and analysis of its conservation status across Australia. These compiled data form an extremely valuable national collection that demanded publishing in open, readily accessible online repositories such as the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network](http://www.tern.org.au/) and the [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au/), the Australian node of the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](http://www.gbif.org/). This webinar will take you through the workflow from the original data collection in which the presenter participated as a young student, to the present-day deposition of the data in a modern repository. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this project will trigger a sober review of the value of endangered data and the importance of suitable and timely archiving so the initial unique collection investment enables multiple re-use in perpetuity.
