short_abstract: There has been significant advances on making data publicly available
  however other products, such as code detailing the research workflow, should also
  be in the open. For the past four years, we have dramatically improved how we work
  with the Ocean Health Index by embracing open data science practices and tools.
  We’re sharing our story because at the time we thought this transformation was intimidating,
  but we are living proof that it’s possible.

  Working in an open environment, publishing software, code, data in an openly accessible format, supports the reproducibility, integrity and usability of research. There has been significant advances on making data publicly available however other products, such as code detailing the research workflow, should also be in the open. For the past four years, we have dramatically improved how we work with the Ocean Health Index by embracing open data science practices and tools. We now work in a way that is more reproducible, transparent, collaborative, and open, with more emphasis on communication. Our work is more reproducible and streamlined, and more than 20 countries around the world are building off our science and our code to assess ocean health in their own jurisdictions.

  We’re sharing our story because at the time we thought this transformation was intimidating, but we are living proof that it’s possible. By describing specific tools and how we incrementally began using them for the Ocean Health Index project, we hope to encourage others in the scientific community to do the same — so we can all produce better science in less time.
