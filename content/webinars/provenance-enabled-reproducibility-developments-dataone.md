abstract: |-
  Reproducible research is enabled, in part, by provenance metadata that describes the lineage and processing history of data and knowledge artifacts. Provenance plays an important role in many scientific applications and use cases. Yet this information is often not tracked as thoroughly and systematically as science metadata. DataONE has been working on tools to display provenance information and to support recording of provenance metadata through programming languages such as R and Matlab and through an intuitive, user friendly, web-based UI.

  During this webinar we will describe the history to date, showcasing the tools developed and providing a demonstration of the new web-based provenance editor. We highlight the collaborative efforts in building a community around provenance, and introduce future integration with WholeTale and other community initiatives.
