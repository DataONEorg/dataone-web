short_abstract: Although data-driven research is already accelerating scientific discovery,
  substantial systemic challenges still exist in academia that impact both individual
  researchers and institutional decision-making. These challenges need to be overcome
  for academia to fully realize the promise of the new data era. Toward that end,
  the Academic Data Science Alliance (academicdatascience.org) was established to
  provide an independent resource network with community building and advocacy opportunities
  for data scientists in academia across the U.S. and beyond.

  sharing of best practices and lessons learned from higher education institutes experimenting
  with the integration of data science. This talk will cover ADSA’s efforts and activities,
  ways to engage, and include some lessons learned from Micaela’s 6+ years of experience
  in collaborative institutional experimentation through her work with the Moore-Sloan
  Data Science Environments (msdse.org).
