short_abstract: This presentation will describe capabilities of ISO 19157 with examples
  of how they can be used to describe data quality and also compare these approaches
  with other standards.
abstract: "Well-documented data quality is critical in situations where scientists
  and decision-makers need to combine multiple datasets from different disciplines
  and instrumentation to address scientific questions or difficult decisions. Standardized
  data quality metadata could be very helpful in these situations. Many efforts at
  developing data quality standards falter because of the diversity of approaches
  to measuring and reporting data quality. The “one size fits all” paradigm does not
  generally work well in this situation.\n\nThe ISO data quality standard (ISO 19157)
  was recently endorsed by the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee. Rather than
  seeking to align different quality measurement systems (a daunting task), the standard
  focuses on systematically describing how data quality is measured. ISO 19157 also
  introduces the idea of standard data quality measures that can be well documented
  in a shared repository and used for consistently describing how data quality is
  measured across an enterprise. The standard includes recommendations for properties
  of these measures that include unique identifiers, references, illustrations and
  examples. Metadata records can reference these measures using the unique identifier
  and reuse them along with details (and references) that describe how the measure
  was applied to a particular dataset.  \nA second important new feature of ISO 19157
  is the inclusion of citations to existing papers or reports that describe quality
  of a dataset. This capability allows users to find this information in a single
  location, i.e. the dataset metadata, rather than searching the web or other catalogs.
  This presentation will describe these and other capabilities of ISO 19157 with examples
  of how they can be used to describe data quality and also compare these approaches
  with other standards."
