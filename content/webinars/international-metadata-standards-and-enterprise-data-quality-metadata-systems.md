short_abstract: R2R is the NSF-supported repository for environmental sensor data
  routinely acquired by U.S. oceanographic research vessels. The research fleet supports
  hundreds of expeditions around the world each year, ranging from oceans to coasts
  and estuaries to the Great Lakes. R2R works with an extensive network of partner
  repositories to link original field data from both sensors and samples, post-field
  products, global syntheses, and journal articles.
