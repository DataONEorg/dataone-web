  system. '
abstract: Data management is a fundamental skill to any researcher, but implementing
  data management practices is often reserved for when data get "big" or "complex."
  In reality, all data can benefit from good management and organization practices,
  regardless of the size or complexity of the data. This webinar introduces the concept
  of relational data modeling and how it can be used as a principle for organizing
  data, even without a database management system. Using a relational data model creates
  a “tidy” data structure, which makes data easier to search, filter, document, and
  analyze.
