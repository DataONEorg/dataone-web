short_abstract: In the webinar, we will discuss the findings from Phase 1 in which
  we gathered information about the needs of researchers– how do they want to get
  credit for the data they produce? What do they want to know about how their data
  is used? What do they want to know about others’ data to evaluate quality? We connected
  with the community to determine requirements and understand use cases for the data-level
  metrics prototype.
abstract: |-
  California Digital Libraries, PLOS, and DataONE are partners in Make Data Count ([https://makedatacount.org/](https://makedatacount.org/ "https://makedatacount.org/")), an NSF-funded project to design and develop metrics that track and measure data use, i.e. “data-level metrics” (DLMs). DLMs are a multi-dimensional suite of indicators, measuring the broad range of activity surrounding the reach and use of data as a research output.

  In the webinar, we will discuss the findings from Phase 1 in which we gathered information about the needs of researchers– how do they want to get credit for the data they produce? What do they want to know about how their data is used? What do they want to know about others’ data to evaluate quality? We connected with the community to determine requirements and understand use cases for the data-level metrics prototype. We will also demo the latest from our working prototype and share the initial results (usage, citations, scholarly references and mentions, social media, etc.) collected on datasets from DataONE member repositories.
