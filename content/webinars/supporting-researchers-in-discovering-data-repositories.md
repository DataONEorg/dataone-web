abstract: "How do researchers go about identifying a repository to preserve their
  data? Do they have all the information they need to make an informed decision? Are
  there resources available to help?\n\nThere are a myriad of repositories available
  to support data preservation and they differ across multiple axes. So which one
  is right for your data? The answer is largely, 'it depends'. But this can be frustrating
  to a new researcher looking to publish data for the first time. What questions need
  to be asked to detangle these dependencies and where can a researcher go for answers?\n\nConversations
  and sessions at domain conferences have consistently suggested that researchers
  need more support in navigating the landscape of data repositories and with support
  from ESIP Funding Friday, we sought to do that. In this webinar we will introduce
  a resource under development that aims to serve as a gateway for information about
  repository selection. With links to existing resources, games and outreach materials,
  we aim to facilitate discovery of data repositories and we welcome contributions
  to increase the value of this resource.   "
