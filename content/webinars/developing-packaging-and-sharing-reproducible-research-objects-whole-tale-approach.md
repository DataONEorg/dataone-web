short_abstract: A key objective of the NSF-funded Whole Tale project is to make the
  development, sharing, and reuse of reproducible research objects more seamless,
  both for creators and users of "tales". Tales can be seen as a special kind of research
  object that bundle data and metadata, but also code and the runtime execution environment
  necessary to reproduce the computational aspects of a research paper. In this webinar,
  we will illustrate the Whole Tale approach using a number of simple examples and
  demonstrations.
abstract: 'It has been recognized for some time now that sharing data is critical
  when publishing research findings. For example the FAIR principles for scientific
  data management and stewardship require that data be findable, accessible, interoperable,
  and reusable. Scientific data repositories and networks such as DataONE provide
  researchers with ways to share and publish research data, bundled with appropriate
  metadata to allow peers to interpret and reuse the data products associated with
  research papers. Increasingly, the need to share code (i.e., scripts and analysis
  programs) used in the generation, analysis, and visualization of data---alongside
  the data products---has been recognized as well. However, it remains challenging
  (if not impossible) for many potential users of a research object to deal with the
  installation of complex software dependencies and the appropriate parameterization
  and execution of multiple scripts contained in often complicated, nested research
  objects. A key objective of the NSF-funded Whole Tale project is to make the development,
  sharing, and reuse of reproducible research objects more seamless, both for creators
  and users of "tales". Tales can be seen as a special kind of research object that
  bundle data and metadata, but also code and the runtime execution environment necessary
  to reproduce the computational aspects of a research paper. In particular, a human-centered
  narrative, e.g., in the form of a Jupyter (or RStudio) notebook can be used as the
  central element of research tales that interleave scientific explanations, code
  and visualizations. By making it easier to develop, package, share, and execute
  tales, different types of users are supported by the Whole Tale approach: researchers
  can easily combine data from different sources (e.g., DataONE member repositories), analyze
  and visualize the data, and then bundle up their research products---together with
  the software environment used to generate the products---and share the resulting
  tales. Peers can use the shared tales, e.g., as part of a review process (associated
  with a scientific publication) or make it the basis for their own research. In this
  webinar we will illustrate the Whole Tale approach using a number of simple examples
  and demonstrations.'
