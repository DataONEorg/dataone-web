short_abstract: The term “open science” means different things to different people.
  During this webinar we will explain how Mozilla’s definition of open science has
  evolved over time. As a result, our programs have grown and fostered an open community
  that has outgrown the original Mozilla science team, includes partnerships outside
  Mozilla, and has now expanded beyond just science.
abstract: |-
  The term “open science” means different things to different people. For some it means open access to publications and peer review. For others, it’s all about reproducibility through the sharing of research data and code. Still others view open science as synonymous with citizen science.

  During this webinar we will explain how Mozilla’s definition of open science has evolved over time. As a result, our programs have grown and fostered an open community that has outgrown the original Mozilla science team, includes partnerships outside Mozilla, and has now expanded beyond just science. Due to the best practices inherent in working open, the work is being sustained beyond our original resources and investments into a movement with a global reach.
