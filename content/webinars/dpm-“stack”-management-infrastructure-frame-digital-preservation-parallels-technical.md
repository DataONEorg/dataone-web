  Management stack with requisite layers of organizational infrastructure for sustainable
  digital preservation programs. The DPM stack applies concepts from the DPM model,
  an organizational maturity model that defines five stages to build a sustainable
  program. This is represented by a three-legged stool with an organizational, a technological,
  and a resources leg.
abstract: It is common in discussing technical infrastructure to talk about the IT
  “stack”. This discussion walks through a model for the Digital Preservation Management
  stack with requisite layers of organizational infrastructure for sustainable digital
  preservation programs. The DPM stack applies concepts from the DPM model, an organizational
  maturity model that defines five stages to build a sustainable program. This is
  represented by a three-legged stool with an organizational, a technological, and
  a resources leg.
