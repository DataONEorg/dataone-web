short_abstract: This webinar panel will feature presentations and discussion drawn
  from recent projects that have focused on the development, implementation, and use
  of data management plans in academic library settings. We will share how to build
  working relationships with other campus offices that can bring much-needed visibility
  to data management plan (DMP) review services. We will also discuss a case where
  one DMP consultation provided a gateway to fostering deeper, more impactful research
  support that resulted in more robust data management practices for a multidisciplinary
  research team.
abstract: |-
  There continues to be a need for data management services that effectively support the needs of researchers. One key area of growth for academic libraries is serving as active collaborators with faculty and researchers as part of the research process. Recognizing this need for additional data management structures, DataONE was an early partner in a grassroots effort (along with seven other institutions) to develop the DMPTool, starting in January 2011. This was in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that researchers create and submit plans for managing their research data.

  Since then, data management plans have continued to generate interest, study, and development. This webinar panel will feature presentations and discussion drawn from recent projects that have focused on the development, implementation, and use of data management plans in academic library settings. We will share how to build working relationships with other campus offices that can bring much-needed visibility to data management plan (DMP) review services. We will also discuss a case where one DMP consultation provided a gateway to fostering deeper, more impactful research support that resulted in more robust data management practices for a multidisciplinary research team. Finally, we’ll discuss what the process of reviewing data management plans can reveal about researchers’ habits, and what recent investigations into DMP follow-through have shown.
