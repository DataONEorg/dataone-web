abstract: As science becomes increasingly complex and collaborative – spanning disciplines,
  organizations and locations, we’re beginning to appreciate the importance not just
  of technical infrastructure such as online tools, but also human infrastructure
  to support our group efforts. Join us for a webinar with Lou Woodley, Director of
  the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE) where we’ll
  discuss the different types of communities within science and what supporting collaboration
  looks like in each case. Lou will also give a brief overview of CSCCE’s activities
  – including new online programming to support scientists who are engaging in building
  collaborations and community-led projects.
