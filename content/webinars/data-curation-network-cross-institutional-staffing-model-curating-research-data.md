short_abstract: The Data Curation Network is a community of experts who have the software
  skills and domain know-how needed to curate digital research data, thereby ensuring
  those data are valuable and reusable for the long-term. The Data Curation Network
  provides a shared staffing model for experts across member institutions as well
  as a commitment to promoting the value of curation with the broader research community.
  This presentation will address how we are organized, the curation procedures we
  use, and how we hope to grow in the future.
abstract: "The Data Curation Network is a community of experts who have the software
  skills and domain know-how needed to curate digital research data, thereby ensuring
  those data are valuable and reusable for the long-term. Specialized curatorial actions
  to best prepare data for reuse include quality assurance, file integrity checks,
  documentation review, metadata creation for discoverability, and file transformations
  into archival formats. Due to the heterogeneous and multidisciplinary nature of
  research data generated in our research institutions, the skills and expertise required
  to curate data (to prepare, arrange, describe, and test data for optimal reuse)
  cannot reasonably be provided by a few experts siloed at single institutions. The
  Data Curation Network provides a shared staffing model for experts across member
  institutions as well as a commitment to promoting the value of curation with the
  broader research community. This presentation will address how we are organized,
  the curation procedures we use, and how we hope to grow in the future.  \n[http://datacurationnetwork.org](http://datacurationnetwork.org
