abstract: 'Crafting responsive tools for the sharing of data and knowledge requires
  understanding the people who will use them. In particular, exploring and studying
  how and why researchers perceive incentives, risks, and rewards for sharing research
  data may provide additional approaches and paths towards increasing openness. This
  webinar will be broadcast from SciDataCon during International Data Week in Denver,
  Colorado, and will feature panelists who plan to discuss their work in the areas
  of: data as social capital, giving researchers credit for data, and the results
  of a case study on perceived versus actual risks of data sharing.'
