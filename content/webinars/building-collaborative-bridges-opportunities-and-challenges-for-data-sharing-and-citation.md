short_abstract: Pulling from examples within the research data management community,
  this webinar will discuss data citation infrastructures, solutions, and challenges.
  We will talk about social and technological bridges that enable and support open
  data sharing, and the importance (and challenges) of capturing relationships across
  research and datasets.
abstract: Several key themes have emerged that begin to define a path towards functional
  infrastructure. A central theme is the broad and careful use of persistent identifiers
  (PIDs) for data, documents, data types, instruments, people, etc., so that computers
  can unambiguously identify and locate key resources and their descriptions. One
  particular use of identifiers is in data citation and referencing. Pulling from
  examples within the research data management community, this webinar will discuss
  data citation infrastructures, solutions, and challenges. We will talk about social
  and technological bridges that enable and support open data sharing, and the importance
  (and challenges) of capturing relationships across research and datasets.
