  Over the past ten years DataONE has focused on both making earth and environmental data accessible, and also highlighting the importance of strong skills in data management for researchers. We have published data management education modules, led workshops to develop best practices, created user profiles as exemplars, and have introduced many on-point webinar speakers. As a next step we are moving many of these materials to a community-based platform to increase their use and usability by the research community. Education materials are now being hosted through GitHub on our Data Management Skillbuilding Hub and users can download, edit, and contribute to keeping them updated. Need to make changes to a lesson and want to share them with other instructors? By forking these materials in GitHub and making changes, edits and improvements are accessible to others.

  The Data Management Skillbuilding Hub is designed as a space for community contribution and enhancement. Recognizing the wealth of relevant content in the community, and the importance of discoverability across platforms, we are collaborating with the Data Management Training Clearinghouse to index DataONE resources. Unfamiliar with the DMTClearinghouse? Tune in to learn more! This webinar will provide an overview of DataONE education resources, the new Data Management Skillbuilding Hub and the Data Management Training Clearinghouse in addition to providing attendees with information on how to get involved.
