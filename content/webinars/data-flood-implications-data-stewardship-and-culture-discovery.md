short_abstract: This webinar will discuss how different points in the research lifecycle
  can affect reproducibility and why tracking how research evolves over time is important
  for reproducibility. The webinar will also introduce the Open Science Framework,
  a free, open source webtool designed by the Center for Open Science to help researchers
  manage, document, and share their entire research lifecycle.
abstract: Over the past few years there has been a growing movement to make data and
  code openly available to increase the reproducibility of scientific research. While
  these steps are important, they leave out information about how research questions,
  hypotheses, and analytical decisions may have changed over time. This type of information
  can have important implications for the reproducibility and interpretation of scientific
  findings. This webinar will discuss how different points in the research lifecycle
  can affect reproducibility and why tracking how research evolves over time is important
  for reproducibility. The webinar will also introduce the Open Science Framework,
  a free, open source webtool designed by the Center for Open Science to help researchers
  manage, document, and share their entire research lifecycle.
