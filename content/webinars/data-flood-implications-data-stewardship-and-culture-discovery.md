short_abstract: 'A new focus on making research data publicly available is sweeping
  through the research community and being highlighted in public discussions of research.
  Several trends have come together to prompt this discussion: Most data generated
  today begin as digital rather than analog data, whether they are collected automatically
  by instruments connected to computers, or entered into computers for analysis after
  collection.'
abstract: 'A new focus on making research data publicly available is sweeping through
  the research community and being highlighted in public discussions of research.
  Several trends have come together to prompt this discussion: Most data generated
  today begin as digital rather than analog data, whether they are collected automatically
  by instruments connected to computers, or entered into computers for analysis after
  collection. A new concern about ensuring that observations, experiments, and models
  are reproducible requires access to original data. And the open access publication
  movement is accompanied by a parallel demand for open access to the data on which
  the publications are based. These developments challenge scientific publications
  to find ways to ensure data availability. They challenge researchers who are used
  to having exclusive access to their data for years, if not for their entire career.
  They challenge researchers to be more forthcoming about the basis for research.
  And they challenge all data repositories to accommodate and curate many more data
  sets. The cost of such stewardship is a challenge to universities, to research consortia,
  and to governments. Such open data access has the ability to change the demographics
  of research and the style of discovery.'
