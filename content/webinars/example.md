abstract: "The Permafrost Discovery Gateway is a new NSF Navigating the New Arctic
  (NNA) award that will create an online platform for archiving, processing, analyzing,
  and visualizing permafrost big imagery products for discovery and knowledge-generation.
  This new online scientific gateway will provide access to high resolution satellite
  data products and visualization tools that expand on the Gapminder Foundation, Google
  Earth and Fluid Earth Viewer to enable exploration of changes in permafrost across
  decades. Designed as a community resource, we want input across all stages of development.
  Join us for this interactive webinar to learn about the Permafrost Discovery Gateway
  and inform initial development. Which geospatial data are critical for inclusion?
  How will you use the resource and what functionality do you need? How can we improve
  on efficiencies in your data discovery and access workflow?  \nPlease also visit
  our website ([permafrost.arcticdata.io](permafrost.arcticdata.io)) to learn more
  and to join our mailing list for future updates and opportunities to contribute."
