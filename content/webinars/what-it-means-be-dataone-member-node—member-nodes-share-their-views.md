abstract: DataONE Member Repositories are the key to getting research data available through
  DataONE and are the site where data is gathered, managed, and stored. As part of
  the DataONE federation, Member Repositories expose all or portions of their data products
  by implementing a common set of service interfaces. Member Repositories are typically existing
  data repositories within the earth science domain and often already fill an important
  role in their respective communities supporting data management, curation, discovery,
  and access functions. These preservation-oriented repositories invest time and resources
  to join DataONE’s persistent, reliable, and sustainable cyberinfrastructure with
  the common goal to unite environment-based research through its distributed architecture.
  The benefits of which can lead to better visibility and dissemination of their data,
  long-term data management, and broader community engagement.
