short_abstract: In this webinar, Software Carpentry's co-founder will explore what's
  been learned along the away about what scientists, engineers, and other researchers
  actually need to know about programming in order to make their work more shareable,
  more reproducible, more likely to be correct, and more efficient. He will also discuss
  practices that the DataONE community and similar groups may be able to use to help
  researchers deal with large or messy data in a broad range of disciplines.
abstract: Since 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a week-long training course
  at the US national laboratories into a worldwide volunteer effort to improve researchers'
  computing skills. In this webinar, Software Carpentry's co-founder will explore
  what's been learned along the away about what scientists, engineers, and other researchers
  actually need to know about programming in order to make their work more shareable,
  more reproducible, more likely to be correct, and more efficient. He will also discuss
  practices that the DataONE community and similar groups may be able to use to help
  researchers deal with large or messy data in a broad range of disciplines.
