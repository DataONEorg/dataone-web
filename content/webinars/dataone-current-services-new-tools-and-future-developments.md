abstract: The Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) is an NSF-supported DataNet
  project which is developing a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure
  that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure
  access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data. Now in
  its seventh year of funding, DataONE has released a number of tools, services and
  programs that support users in their data management, discovery, preservation and
  education needs. In this overview we will introduce the guiding principles of DataONE,
  the primary components of the DataONE cyberinfrastructure, provide a brief demonstration
  of some of the DataONE tools and services and discuss future development and activities.
