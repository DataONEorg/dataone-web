  The Data Curation Network presents a new resource to add to your data curation toolkit. “Data curation primers” are a concise, actionable resource to assist data curators in adding value to a dataset. These evolving documents detail a specific subject, disciplinary area or curation task, and can be used as a reference or jump-start to curating research data.

  The first set of these primers, authored by teams of experts, [have just been published](https://sites.psu.edu/dcnworkshops/primers/) and cover the following data types/formats: Microsoft Excel; Microsoft Access; Geodatabases; netCDF; Jupyter Notebooks, SPSS; and [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) websites. More primers are in the works and set to be published in Fall 2019.

  Data curation primers were the direct output of an [IMLS-funded workshop](https://sites.psu.edu/dcnworkshops/) series hosted by the partners in the [Data Curation Network (DCN)](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdatacurationnetwork.org%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ccuv185%40psu.edu%7C917a8374976849a2fabe08d6fe72a398%7C7cf48d453ddb4389a9c1c115526eb52e%7C0%7C0%7C636976165656798728&sdata=nLeJiH6IDUN6oBH5QIDg7Lr8Iunew9BbqqQsqV7vAvA%3D&reserved=0) and leverage the expertise of data curators nation-wide.
