short_abstract: In 2014, Wiley invited thousands of researchers from all disciplines
  and all geographies to participate in a large scale survey on data sharing. The
  goal of the research was to identify the what, where, how and why behind researcher
  data sharing currently, and the barriers that keep researchers from sharing. This
  session will explore the results of that study along with the outputs of other recent
  surveys into researcher perceptions of and behaviours around data sharing.
