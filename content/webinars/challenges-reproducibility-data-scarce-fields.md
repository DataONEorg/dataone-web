short_abstract: In data scarce fields, which characterizes much of the earth sciences,
  reproducing results is even more challenging. Among the factors that limit reproducibility
  are data access, collection, curation, and accessibility. We discuss the extent
  to which reproducibility is an appropriate goal in data scarce domains and the tradeoffs
  between data reuse and reproducibility.
abstract: Reproducing scientific results is difficult in fields whose research is
  characterized by large volumes of data, computationally intensive methods, and high
  degrees of standardization. In data scarce fields, which characterizes much of the
  earth sciences, reproducing results is even more challenging. Among the factors
  that limit reproducibility are data access, collection, curation, and accessibility.
  We discuss the extent to which reproducibility is an appropriate goal in data scarce
  domains and the tradeoffs between data reuse and reproducibility.
