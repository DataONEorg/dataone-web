    details: Data portals are a fundamental component of the new service offerings
      from DataONE. They allow researchers, labs, collaborative networks, and organizations
      of all sizes to bring together distributed data in a single discovery location.
      In this session, participants will be guided through the process of creating
      a live data portal in real time. We will introduce multiple features of data
      portals and how portals can be used to elevate your research visibility increasing
      data discovery, access, and reuse.

      will give an overview of the Hosted Repository service and how it can help labs,
      departments, non-profits, or other organizations that want to participate in
      DataONE but don't have the servers or staff to maintain their systems. We'll
      talk with a panel of researchers who are using this service or may benefit from
      it, and will discuss how to improve it for the needs of the community.
