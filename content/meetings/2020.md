    details: In the past year over which DataONE has transitioned from a largely NSF-funded
      project to an ongoing community-driven program, significant progress has been
      made towards reshaping and sustaining the DataONE community and network. This
      opening plenary for the DataONE Community Meeting will provide an overview of
      the meeting, provide an update on the status of the program, provide some member
      node highlights, and provide a high-level description of the program's network
      and financial sustainability strategy moving forward.
