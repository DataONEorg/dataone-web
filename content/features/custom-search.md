    content: "Mix and match from up to six varieties of search filters for researchers
      to use on your portal:\n\n(add an image of each filter type)\n\n* Free-text
      \ \n* Dropdown menu \n* Toggle \n* Checkbox\n* Date \n* Number\n\nChoose which
      fields from your metadata that the filter will search from, such as title, keywords,
      creators, data attributes, species, or geographic area description. \n\nCustomize
      the look of your portal search fields by adding an icon, a title, and placeholder
      example text. (Show some icon examples)\n\nFurther customize the search display by grouping related filters
      together. (add screenshot of tabbed filter groups)\n\nAllow your community to
      search by geographic location using an interactive map. Zoom into the area where
      your research is focused by setting a specific center point and zoom level for
      the map. (add screenshot of the data tab map)\n\nWant to turn off the map altogether?
      You can do that too.\n\n(Footnote in subtle style): These portal features will
      soon be available in the portal editor, but until then, our team can configure
      these portal features behind-the-scenes."
