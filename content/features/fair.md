  title: Guide your community towards creating better metadata
  intro: Researchers can view metadata assessment reports for their datasets and discover
    exactly which metadata fields are missing or incomplete.

    content: "### Detailed FAIR reports for each dataset\n\nWhenever a dataset is
      updated in your Hosted Repository, the metadata is automatically assessed according
      to the \\[FAIR data principles\\](inner-page link to What is FAIR? section on
      this page).\n\nEach assessment is made of a number of individual checks that
      assess specific fields in the metadata, such as geographic coverage, start and
      end dates, data attributes, or publication date (among many more). \n\nAt a
      glance, see how each dataset scores in terms of identification, discoverability,
      and ease of interpretation by viewing the total score for checks in that category."

    content: |-
      \- Aggregated FAIR score charts show how your FAIR scores have changed month-to-month, so you can quantify your metadata improvement efforts.

      \- Aggregated scores are divided into the four FAIR categories, so you can pinpoint areas that need improvement and see what your metadata strengths are.

      (show screenshot of aggregated FAIR chart next to those two bullets)

      \*Plus subscribers:* A FAIR scores chart is included in each DataONE Plus portal with scores only for that dataset collection.

      \*Hosted Repositories:* Each Hosted Repository includes a FAIR scores chart for the entire repository holdings.
