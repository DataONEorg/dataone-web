  title: Guide your community towards creating better metadata
  intro: Researchers can view metadata assessment reports for their datasets and discover
    exactly which metadata fields are missing or incomplete.

    content: "### Detailed FAIR reports for each dataset\n\nWhenever a dataset is
      updated in your Hosted Repository, the metadata is automatically assessed according
      to the \\[FAIR data principles\\](inner-page link to What is FAIR? section on
      this page).\n\nEach assessment is made of a number of individual checks that
      assess specific fields in the metadata, such as geographic coverage, start and
      end dates, data attributes, or publication date (among many more). \n\nAt a
      glance, see how each dataset scores in terms of identification, discoverability,
      and ease of interpretation by viewing the total score for checks in that category."
