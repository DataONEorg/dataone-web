    **Are your data ready?**
  intro: At a glance, see how your data score in categories of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability ("FAIR"). With assessments based on the [community established FAIR data principles](#what-is-fair), you can guide your community toward maximizing the value of their digital assets.

        Each assessment is made of a number of individual checks that
