        Whenever a dataset is
        updated in your Hosted Repository, the metadata is automatically assessed according
        to the [FAIR data principles](#what-is-fair).

        Each assessment is made of a number of individual checks that
        assess specific fields in the metadata, such as geographic coverage, start and
        end dates, data attributes, or publication date (among many more).

        Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.
