description: |-
  The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis invites applications for a pool of qualified temporary Data Fellows (Junior Specialist positions) to engage in data science projects relating to environmental science. These projects may include organization and analysis of data sets, developing software and libraries in support of ecological synthesis and data science projects, and/or creating learning curricula for enhance data literacy across the community. The Fellows will work closely with Project Data Coordinators, Scientific Programmers and/or Community Outreach leads to identify and scope project activities. They will work with other members of the data support team members and with scientists from targeted projects and working groups conducting research in support of project goals. The Fellows will gather and analyze data and document processes and results. Research activities may include web scraping, collaboration with external scientists, and investigation and synthesis of environmental data. Fellows will assist in developing tools and resources that utilize these data, including data visualizations, data quality analysis, automated metadata creation, data semantics or data training. For a list of example activities demonstrating the breadth and scope of work undertaken by Data Fellows please visit: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/fellowships/data-science-fellowship-recruitment. Development of tools and resources involves working in concert with data and computer scientists to devise and test user interfaces for the environmental science community. These tools and resources facilitate the processes surrounding documentation, analysis, and interpretation of environmental data.
  
  The department is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community through research, teaching and service.
