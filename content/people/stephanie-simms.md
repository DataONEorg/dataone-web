  Stephanie Simms is a Research Data Specialist at the California Digital Library and Product Manager for the DMPTool. In both roles, she provides the 10 University of California campuses and beyond with technical, educational, and policy-related support for research data management and open scholarship initiatives. Her current focus is coordinating global efforts to transform data management plans from an annoying administrative exercise into a useful tool for researchers, funders, and other stakeholders by making them machine actionable.

  Prior to joining the CDL, Stephanie was a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow at UCLA where she worked on geospatial data and data publishing projects. Her own archaeological research experiences involved plenty of challenges with managing and sharing myriad types of data, both physical and digital, and inform her current work. She holds a PhD in Archaeology and is a member of the DataONE Users Group and co-chair of the RDA Active DMPs Interest Group.
