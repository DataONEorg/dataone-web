  Mark was the Director of Computing at NCEAS from it's opening in 1995 until 2017, in charge of building and maintaining the computational infrastructure, and supervising the scientific computing staff. He recently "semi-retired" to become a Center Associate, focused on Ecoinformatics research.

  Mark's main research interest is in how to organize data for ecological syntheses. He is currently working in the area of data semantics and knowledge graphs, where they are using new logic-technology approaches to make data more readily discoverable and re-usable over the Web.

  He grew up and went to high school in Southern California, but headed back east to Harvard for an undergraduate degree in Biology. Mark came back to UC Santa Barbara for a PhD in marine ecology, doing research on coral reef fish in the San Blas Islands of Panama.
