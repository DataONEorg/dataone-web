  I work on problems in ecological forecasting and decision making under
  uncertainty, with applications for global change, conservation and natural
  resource management. I am particularly interested in how we can predict or
  manage ecological systems that may experience regime shifts: sudden and
  dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available data. The rapid
  expansion in both computational power and the available ecological and
  environmental data enables and requires new mathematical, statistical and
  computational approaches to these questions. Ecology has much to learn about
  what are and are not useful from advances in informatics & computer science,
  just as it has from statistics and mathematics. Traditional approaches to
  ecological modeling and resource management such as stochastic dynamic
  systems, Bayesian inference, and optimal control theory must be adapted both
  to take advantage of all available data while also dealing with its
  imperfections. My approach blends ecological theory with the synthesis of
  heterogeneous data and the development of software -- a combination now
  recognized as data science.
