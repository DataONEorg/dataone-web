longbio: Jim Duncan serves as the director of the Forest Ecosystem Monitoring Cooperative,
  where he strives to improve access to information and monitoring of forested ecosystems
  in the northeast. He supports Cooperators by making long-term monitoring data on
  the regionâ€™s forested ecosystems more accessible, providing needed aggregation and
  syntheses of disparate data into products that are more useful for seeing and responding
  to change, and building new regional networks for greater collaboration in monitoring.
  He also supports interdisciplinary teams in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment
  and Natural Resources with spatiotemporal analysis and integration of social and
  ecological data, and serves on his towns tree board. He previously worked to increase
  transparency in the oil, gas and mining sectors by giving decision makers and citizens
  tools to map and interact with data, including in Mongolia and Ghana.
