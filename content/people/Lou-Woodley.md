  Lou spent 5 years at Nature Publishing Group trialing new online tools for scientists
  and organizing community-led events focused on the intersection of science, technology
  and communication. Subsequently, at AAAS, she supported the development of Trellis,
  an online communication and collaboration platform for scientists, as well as working
  on diversity and inclusion projects funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\nMost
