longbio: Megan Mach is DataONE’s Communication and Outreach postdoctoral scholar,
  working with Dr. Amber Budden and the Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Working
  Group. Megan is here to help get the word out about DataONE and the importance of
  responsible data management. She dabbles in graphic design, web-wrangling, and learning
  more about the delicate art of communication plans. Though marine ecology has long
  been her focus, she is working at DataONE because she believes in the inherent value
  of visuals and marketing as tools to increase interest and buy-in in the sciences.
  Megan holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Washington,
  a Master of Science in marine biology from Boston University, and a doctorate degree
  in Resource Management and Environmental Studies from the University of British
  Columbia.
