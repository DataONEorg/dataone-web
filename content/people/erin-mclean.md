  Erin works with Arctic Data Center and the community of research scientists that use it, teaching them how to upload and use the data in the repository, as well as coordinating any other outreach activities.

  Erin has always been interested in science communication and, as such, has spent most of her career in informal science education with aquariums and after school programs, teaching K-12 students about the wonders of the ocean and inspiring the next generation of ocean stewards. More recently, she managed partnerships for Kaplan Test Prep, and she's happy to be back in science where she belongs!

  Erin has a bachelor's degree in Marine Science and English Literature from Boston University and a Master's of Science in Biological and Environmental Sciences from the University of Rhode Island. Her thesis research was on the growth response of American lobsters to simulated ocean acidification conditions.
