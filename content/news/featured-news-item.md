# Transition to the Future
The DataONE network provides search, discovery, access, and preservation for hundreds of thousands of data sets, and advanced services including data replication and citation reporting for its members. DataONE enters its second decade with a renewed sense of purpose and the goal of helping make earth observation data progressively more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

We invite participation from current collaborators, new partners, and the broader community as DataONE continues to plan for the long-term future and accessibility of Earth and environmental data through the development of the broader DataONE Program.
