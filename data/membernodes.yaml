    Member repositories share data, infrastructure, and expertise with DataONE. Member repos expose all or portions of its data
    holdings, or host data from other repositories. Researchers wishing to share data via DataONE are encouraged to do so through member repos within their
    scientific domain, organizational affiliation, or geographic region.
- category: Replication repositories
  description: |-
    Replication repositories provide network-wide services to enhance interoperability of member repositories and
    support indexing and replication services. These organizations provide a replicated catalog of member repository
    metadata holdings and make it easy for scientists to discover data wherever they reside, also
    enabling data repositories to make their data and services more broadly available to the
    international community.
